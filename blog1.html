    <p class="description">Enough HTML, CSS, and JS to get started?</p>

    <article class="blog-center">
      I always wonder what happens when I type google.com in chrome and it
      fetches a web page. What is the magic behinds this? Well, I grow and
      studied computers and finally got to know the answer to my query about web
      page magic. 
      <p>
      I got the answer it is the magic of a combined combination of
      web technologies, That is responsible to fetch the web page in front of
      your eyes when you type anything in the browser. The combination consists
      of three fundamental and major web technologies, That are powering the web
      are:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      I have been personally studying these technologies for a month under the
      umbrella of NeoG camp and believe me, if anything fascinating after Space
      exploration, it is web development. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the question is how much I should
      know about these technologies o before answering that I would like to
      clear one very important thing, Stay away from tutorial hell, I had been a
      victim of this and I ruined my life.
      </p>
      <p>
      Tutorial hell is all about reading
      many tutorials for the same topic and just reading without experimenting
      and implementing the actual things. By doing this we might have good
      knowledge of theory but you won't have practical knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thanks, NeoG for rescuing me. Now the answer to how much you should know about these
      technologies completely depends upon your project requirements, Because
      these are very vast and are updating on a daily basis, so learning in one
      go and then start developing something of your own will take an ample
      amount of time. 
    </p>
    <p>
      So here are some fundamentals of HTML CSS and JS that will
      be very useful if you are just starting with the web, Remember you have to
      make something of your own, even a small calculator program will add value
      to it. 
    </p>
    <p>
    HTML: everyone knows it is a markup language and used to structure
      the webpage and to do that HTML uses tags (elements), each tag can perform
      different types of operations in a structure. 
    </p>
  <p>
      Here are some of the
      important tags that will help you to get started with structuring your
      first web page
<ul>
       <li>header</li>
       <li>footer</li>
       <li>list</li>
       <li>navigation</li>
       <li>table</li>
       <li>div</li>
       <li>a-links</li>
       <li>p-paragraph</li> 
       <li>forms</li>
       <li>input</li>
       <li>class and div</li>
       <li>semantic HTML</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
      If you know these tags then you can easily start structuring your first
      webpage. Now we have made the structure of the web page it's time to
      beautify it, to do so will use CSS. 
    </p>
    <p>
    CSS – it is used to style the web page
      elements (tags), We can use this to cover the HTML elements and can give
      the different types of styles to each element. We can beautify everything
      related to that element. Here are some of the important CSS properties
      that will help you to get started with it
      <ul>


        <li>id-class</li>
        <li>font</li>
        <li>padding</li>
        <li>margin</li>
        <li>border</li>
        <li>height</li>
        <li>width</li>
        <li>colors</li>
        <li>alignment</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
       
 <p>
      So these are the basic CSS properties that will help you to make your
      first stylish and beautiful web page. So far we have made a beautiful web
      page that is very attractive but we want beauty with the brain and our
      brain is JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
    Yes, JavaScript is the brain of web pages because
      JavaScript has logic and it can issue commands to web elements. Nowadays
      JavaScript is running everywhere from browsers to servers Here is a list
      of some basic JavaScript concepts that will be useful to start with web
      development. </p>

  
      <ul>
        <li>Operators (only AND, OR,>,<,+,-,*,/,=)</li>
      
        <li>
        Variables</li>
        <li>Conditions •</li>

        <li>Loops •</li>

        <li>Functions •</li>

        <li>Arrays</li>

        <li>Event listeners</li>

      </ul>
    
    <p>
      If you will combine all these tags, styles, and JS concepts you will end
      up making a good and interactive web page. All the frameworks, libraries
      are a subset of these web technologies. If you will master these, picking
      up any new framework and library will be a piece of cake for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I
      started with level zero videos I had zero ideas about web development, Now
      I can say that I know something about it and the most interesting thing
      is; I am interested in this domain and the greatest regret is I found it
      very late.
