    <p class="description">how to remove brain blocks ?</p>

    <article class="blog-center">
    
      <p>
        Have you ever been to a situation where you want to learn something or want to become good at something 
        but you are not able to do this?
        </p>
        <p> I have been to this situation many times but every time I come up with a solution and am able to come out from it.
  
        Everyone is following and doing the same things and is able to achieve their dreams but you are still struggling. 
    </p>
        How?
  <p>
        Well, It's all about the mindset that we carry at the time of learning, yes it is the mindset that blocks our internal thoughts and progress.
        
        Coming from the same situation many times I have figured out some points that if taken care of well help to cope up with this mental block; 
    </p>
    <p>
        So back in 2015 when I was in my first year I studied C programming that went not well but I become familiar with something called syntax,
         </p>
         <p>
        But still, I had not had many ideas about coding but
        when I graduated in 2019  with no skills, and ended up doing QA. , since then I have studied C, C++, JAVA, and web technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        I got the opportunity to do automation testing which requires either Java or Python along with a selenium automation tool.
    </p>
    <p>
        I opted for java and did it, made some high-level frameworks, and learned a lot about it. 
        
        then I got into web development with neog and still learning it.
        </p>
        <p> I had a fear of coding and programming, so doing end to end testing framework alone was very exciting.
        
        Now the mental block that I had, was not allowing me to get into programming due to fear of not being good at something, I want to be a perfectionist.
    </p>
    <p>
        so here are my five learnings that will help you to become more productive and focused
<ul>
        <li>
            <b>Don't Procrastinate:</b>  If you have something in mind do it right now or ASAP, the more you will procrastinate the more your mind will stop you.
        </li>

    
        <li> <b> Don't be a Perfectionist:</b> in a day you can learn about the syntax and its uses but you can't make a google in a day.</li>
       <li>
       <b>Learn by doing: </b> this is very helpful and if you follow this you can come out from tutorial hell. Learn anything by doing.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b> Document your journey :</b>   whether your are watching youtube or doing something ,take notes ,it will help you to reiterate your learning progress .</li>
        <li>
     <b> Be patient :</b>   this crucial but important ,everything takes time .
    </li>
    </ul>  
</p>
